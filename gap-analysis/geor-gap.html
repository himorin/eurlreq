    <p>This document describes and prioritises gaps for the support of Georgian on the Web and in eBooks. It concerns itself with mkhedruli and mtavruli text, and does not cover khutsuri (asomtavruli/nukhusri) writing sytems. In particular, it is concerned with text layout. It checks that needed features are supported in W3C specifications, in particular HTML and CSS and those relating to digital publications. It also checks whether the features have been implemented in browsers and ereaders. This document complements the document <a href="https://w3c.github.io/eurlreq/georgian">Georgian Layout Requirements</a>, which describes the requirements for areas where gaps appear. It is linked to from the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/typography/gap-analysis/language-matrix.html">language matrix</a> that tracks Web support for many languages.</p>
<p>This document is an individual contribution, and is not currently a work item in any group, however, you can contact the <a href="http://www.w3.org/International/core/">Internationalization Working Group</a> for more information. The end target for this document is a Working Group Note.</p>
</div>

  <section id="h_introduction">
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>The W3C needs to make sure that the  needs of scripts and languages around the world are built in to technologies such as HTML, CSS, SVG, etc. so that Web pages and eBooks can look and behave as people expect around the world.</p>
    
    <p>This page documents difficulties people encounter when trying to use the Georgian language and script on the Web. </p>
<p>Having identified an issue, it investigates the current status with regards to web specifications and implementations by user agents (browsers, e-readers, etc.), and attempts to prioritise the severity of the issue for web users.</p>

    <p>A summary of this report and others can be found as part of the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/typography/gap-analysis/language-matrix.html" style="font-size: 140%;">language matrix</a>.</p>
    
    <section id="workflow">
    <h3>Work flow</h3>
    <p><span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 140%;">This version of the document is a preliminary analysis</span></p>

    <p>Gap analysis work usually starts with a <strong>preliminary analysis</strong>, conducted quickly by one or a small group of experts. Then a more <strong>detailed analysis</strong> is carried out, involving a wider range of experts. The detailed analysis may involve the development of tests, in order to illustrate issues and track results for browsers. The next phase is <strong>ongoing maintenance</strong>. It is expected that the resulting document will not be frozen: as gaps are fixed, this should be noted in the document. It is also possible that new gaps are noticed or arise, and they can be added to this document when that happens.</p>
    
    <!--p>As the gap analysis develops, the requirements for features that are problematic should be described in the companion document, <a href="https://w3c.github.io/xxxxlreq/">Xxxx Layout Requirements</a>. Links to the appropriate part of that document should be added to this document as the material is created. Note that the requirements document should not contain any technology-specific information: all of that belongs here.</p-->
    </section>
    
    <section id="prioritization">
    <h3>Prioritization</h3>
    <p>This document not only describes gaps, it also attempts to prioritise them in terms of the impact on the local user. The prioritisation is indicated by colour.</p>
        
        <p>Key:</p>
  <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
        <li class="ok"></li>
        <li class="na"></li>
        <li class="advanced"></li>
        <li class="basic"></li>
        <li class="broken"></li>
        <li class="tbd"></li>
        </ul>
    
    <p>It is important to note that these colours do not indicate to what extent a particular features is broken. They indicate the impact of a broken or missing feature on the content author or end user.</p>
    <p>Basic styling is the level that would be generally accepted as sufficient for most Web pages. Advanced level support would include additional features one might expect to include in ebooks or other advanced typographic formats. There may be features of a script or language that are not supported on the Web, but that are not generally regarded as necessary (usually archaic or obscure features). In this case, the feature can be described here, but the status should be marked as OK.</p>
    <p>The decision as to what priority level is assigned to a described gap is down to the experts doing the gap analysis. It may not always be straightforward to decide. If a given section in this document refers to more than one feature that is broken, each with different impacts on Web users, the priority for the section should be the lowest denominator.</p>
    <p>A cell can be scored as OK if the feature in question is specified in an appropriate specification, and is supported by user agents. A specification that is in CR or later and has two implementations in 'major' browsers will count. This means that the feature may not be supported in all browsers yet. (At some point in the future we may try to distinguish, visually, whether support is available in a specification but still pending in major browsers or applications.) </p>

<h3>Characters &amp; encoding</h3>
<p id="prompt-charset" class="status_prompt promptStub"></p>

    <p>The situation improved with the addition of mtavruli to Unicode 11 (but see <a href="#fonts"></a> below), and the case mappings between mkedruli and mtavruli, particularly for plain text use.</p>
<!--section id="xxxxxx">

<section id="fonts" class="basic">
<h3>Fonts</h3>
<p id="prompt-fonts" class="status_prompt promptStub"></p>


<section id="mtavruli_missing">
<h3>Mtavruli glyphs needed</h3>
<p>Dedicated mtavruli Unicode characters were only introduced in Unicode v11 (2018). Prior to that, authors had to use special fonts with the mkhedruli code points in order to write mtavruli letters, and CSS text-transforms (ie. to uppercase) had no effect. Unicode 11 introduced not just the new characters, but also mappings from mkhedruli (lowercase) to mtavruli (uppercase).</p>
<p>So far, few fonts have been updated to support the new mtavruli character locations, but text-transforms do have an effect.</p>
<p>This is particularly problematic in pages that are translations of content that was originally in the Latin script, and which applied CSS text-transforms to some text. Prior to Unicode11, there was no need to remove the CSS styling from translated pages, since no text-transform had any effect. Post Unicode 11, however, the mapping to mtavruli characters is being applied and tends to produce tofu.</p>
<p>OS X and iOS currently appear to inhibit the mapping of mkedruli to mtavruli if a font doesn't contain glyphs for the latter. This is not the case, however, for Windows, and the same page will display tofu on that platform.</p>
<p>The best solution for this problem is to update Georgian fonts with support for mtavruli, however this will not resolve the problem for all legacy content. </p>
<p>I'm marking this as a basic issue for now, since producing tofu for existing content is not a good situation.</p>

<h3>Transforming characters</h3>
<p id="prompt-transforms" class="status_prompt promptStub"></p>


    <p>See the issue in [[[#fonts]]] above. Apart from that, there are no issues with text-transforms.</p>
<p>Note that the concept of capitalisation (title-casing or sentence-casing) doesn't actually apply to modern Georgian text. When mkedruli is mapped to mtavruli uppercase, it is applied to one or more whole words at a time (like ALL CAPS). Therefore the CSS for this feature will be ignored by content authors.</p>

<h3>Quotations</h3>
<p id="prompt-quotations" class="status_prompt promptStub"></p>


<section id="q_defaults">
<h4><a href="#q_defaults">Default quotation marks for q element</a></h4>
<p>If the <code class="kw" translate="no">html</code> tag sets the language of a page, the HTML specification says that  the <code class="kw" translate="no">q</code> element should by default produce quotation marks according to the information in CLDR for that language.</p>
<p>For Georgian, CLDR says that the default quote marks should be, reading right to left, “...”, and embedded quote marks ‘...’. <strong>Edge</strong> fails to produce any quotation marks, although it does so for other languages. (Firefox, Chrome &amp; Safari are ok.) See a <a href="https://w3c.github.io/i18n-tests/results/the-q-element.html#language">test and results</a>.</p>
</section>

<section id="q_section">
<h4><a href="#q_section">Default quotation marks in a new language section</a></h4>
<p>In addition, the default quotation marks for the <code class="kw" translate="no">q</code> element  are not set to the appropriate characters by the browser  when the element appears inside a Georgian section of a page that has a different overall language. This is currently per the HTML specification (both W3C and WhatWG).  There is <a href="https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/3636#issuecomment-384340053">an issue</a> raised against the WhatWG version for this to be changed.</p>
</section>

<section id="q_multilingual">
<h4><a href="#q_multilingual">Embedded quotations in a different language</a></h4>
<p>Georgian quotes embedded in text in another language can also be problematic if the outer language uses different quotation marks. This is due to the browsers choosing default quotation marks based on the language of the <em>quotation</em>, rather than that of the surrounding text. See <a href="https://w3c.github.io/i18n-tests/results/the-q-element.html#ml_nesting">a test</a>. This behaviour is specified in the WhatWG version of the HTML spec, but no longer in the W3C version. There is <a href="https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/3636#issuecomment-384340053">an issue</a> raised against the WhatWG version for this to be changed.</p>
</section>

<p>Marking all the above as advanced, because use of the <code class="kw" translate="no">q</code> element is optional (quote characters can be used instead), and it can be styled using CSS for the general case.</p>
