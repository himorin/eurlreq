It also checks whether the features have been implemented in browsers and ereaders. This document complements the document <a href="https://w3c.github.io/eurlreq/georgian">Georgian Layout Requirements</a>, which describes the requirements for areas where gaps appear.

  <section id="h_introduction">
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>The W3C needs to make sure that the text layout and typographic needs of scripts and languages around the world are built in to technologies such as HTML, CSS, SVG, etc. so that Web pages and eBooks can look and behave as people expect around the world.</p>
    
    <p>This page documents issues for languages using the Georgian script in terms of support by specifications or user agents (browsers, e-readers, etc.). </p>

    <p>A summary of this report and others can be found as part of the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/typography/gap-analysis/language-matrix.html" style="font-size: 140%;">language matrix</a>.</p>
    
    <section id="workflow">
    <h3>Work flow</h3>
    <p><span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 140%;">This version of the document is a preliminary analysis</span></p>

    <p>Gap analysis work usually starts with a <strong>preliminary analysis</strong>, conducted quickly by one or a small group of experts. Then a more <strong>detailed analysis</strong> is carried out, involving a wider range of experts. The detailed analysis may involve the development of tests, in order to illustrate issues and track results for browsers. The next phase is <strong>ongoing maintenance</strong>. It is expected that the resulting document will not be frozen: as gaps are fixed, this should be noted in the document. It is also possible that new gaps are noticed or arise, and they can be added to this document when that happens.</p>
    
    <p>As the gap analysis develops, the requirements for features that are problematic should be described in the companion document, <a href="https://w3c.github.io/xxxxlreq/">Georgian Layout Requirements</a>. Links to the appropriate part of that document should be added to this document as the material is created. Note that the requirements document should not contain any technology-specific information: all of that belongs here.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section id="prioritization">
    <h3>Prioritization</h3>
    <p>This document not only describes gaps, it also attempts to prioritise them in terms of the impact on the local user. The prioritisation is indicated by colour.</p>
        
        <p>Key:</p>
  <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
        <li class="ok"></li>
        <li class="na"></li>
        <li class="advanced"></li>
        <li class="basic"></li>
        <li class="broken"></li>
        <li class="tbd"></li>
        </ul>
    
    <p>It is important to note that these colours do not indicate to what extent a particular features is broken. They indicate the impact of a broken or missing feature on the content author or end user.</p>
    <p>Basic styling is the level that would be generally accepted as sufficient for most Web pages. Advanced level support would include additional features one might expect to include in ebooks or other advanced typographic formats. There may be features of a script or language that are not supported on the Web, but that are not generally regarded as necessary (usually archaic or obscure features). In this case, the feature can be described here, but the status should be marked as OK.</p>
    <p>The decision as to what priority level is assigned to a described gap is down to the experts doing the gap analysis. It may not always be straightforward to decide. If a given section in this document refers to more than one feature that is broken, each with different impacts on Web users, the priority for the section should be the lowest denominator.</p>
    <p>A cell can be scored as OK if the feature in question is specified in an appropriate specification, and is supported by user agents. A specification that is in CR or later and has two implementations in 'major' browsers will count. This means that the feature may not be supported in all browsers yet. (At some point in the future we may try to distinguish, visually, whether support is available in a specification but still pending in major browsers or applications.) </p>

<section id="vertical" class="na">
<h3>Vertical text</h3>
    <p class="status_prompt">Are the script requirements for vertically oriented text met?  What about if you mix vertical text with scripts that are normally only horizontal? Do you need a switch to use different characters in vertical vs. horizontal text? Does the browser support short runs of horizontal text in vertical lines (tate-chu-yoko in Japanese) as expected? Is the orientation of characters and the directional ordering of characters supported as needed? <a href="https://w3c.github.io/typography/index#vertical_text">See available information</a> or <a href="https://github.com/w3c/i18n-activity/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3Avertical-text%20label%3Atype-info-request">check for currently needed data</a>.</p>

    <p class="status_prompt">If this script runs right-to-left, are there any issues when handling that? Is bidirectional text adequately supported? What about numbers and expressions?

<h2>Characters and phrases</h2>
    
    
    
<section id="encoding" class="ok">
    <h3>Characters &amp; encoding</h3>
    <p class="status_prompt">Are there any character repertoire issues preventing use of this script on the Web? Do variation selectors need attention?</p>

    <p>The situation improved with the addition of mtavruli to Unicode 11 (but see <a href="#fonts"></a> below), and the case mappings between mkedruli and mtavruli, particularly for plain text use.</p>
</section>



<section id="fonts" class="basic">
    <h3>Fonts</h3>
    <p class="status_prompt">Do the standard fallback fonts used in browsers (eg. serif, sans-serif, cursive, etc.) match expectations? Are special font or OpenType features needed for this script that are not available?  <a href="https://w3c.github.io/typography/index#font-style">See available information</a> or <a href="https://github.com/w3c/i18n-activity/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3Afont-style%20label%3Atype-info-request">check for currently needed data</a>.</p>

<section id="mtavruli_missing">
<h3>Mtavruli glyphs needed</h3>
<p>Dedicated mtavruli Unicode characters were only introduced in Unicode v11 (2018). Prior to that, authors had to use special fonts with the mkhedruli code points in order to write mtavruli letters, and CSS text-transforms (ie. to uppercase) had no effect. Unicode 11 introduced not just the new characters, but also mappings from mkhedruli (lowercase) to mtavruli (uppercase).</p>
<p>So far, few fonts have been updated to support the new mtavruli character locations, but text-transforms do have an effect.</p>
<p>This is particularly problematic in pages that are translations of content that was originally in the Latin script, and which applied CSS text-transforms to some text. Prior to Unicode11, there was no need to remove the CSS styling from translated pages, since no text-transform had any effect. Post Unicode 11, however, the mapping to mtavruli characters is being applied and tends to produce tofu.</p>
<p>OS X and iOS currently appear to inhibit the mapping of mkedruli to mtavruli if a font doesn't contain glyphs for the latter. This is not the case, however, for Windows, and the same page will display tofu on that platform.</p>
<p>The best solution for this problem is to update Georgian fonts with support for mtavruli, however this will not resolve the problem for all legacy content. </p>
<p>I'm marking this as a basic issue for now, since producing tofu for existing content is not a good situation.</p>

<section id="fontstyle" class="ok">
    <h3>Font  styles, weight, etc</h3>
    <p id="fontstylePrompt" class="status_prompt"> This covers ways of modifying the glyphs, such as for italicisation, bolding, oblique, etc. Do italic fonts lean in the right direction? Is synthesised italicisation problematic? Are there other problems relating to bolding or italicisation - perhaps relating to generalised assumptions of applicability? <a href="https://w3c.github.io/typography/index#font-style">See available information</a> or <a href="https://github.com/w3c/i18n-activity/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3Afont-style%20label%3Atype-info-request">check for currently needed data</a>.</p>

</section>



<section id="glyphs" class="na">
    <h3>Glyph shaping and positioning</h3>
    <p class="status_prompt">Does the script in question require additional user control features to support alterations to the position or shape of glyphs, for example adjusting the distance between the base text and diacritics, or changing the glyphs used in a systematic way? Do you need to be able to compose/decompose conjuncts, or show characters that are otherwise hidden, etc? <a href="../index#glyphs_diacritics">See available information</a> or <a href="https://github.com/w3c/i18n-activity/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3Aglyphs-diacritics%20label%3Atype-info-request">check for currently needed data</a>.</p>



    <p></p>
</section>



<section id="cursive" class="na">
    <h3>Cursive text</h3>
    <p class="status_prompt"> If this script is cursive (eg. Arabic, N'Ko, Syriac, etc), are there problems or needed features related to the handling of cursive text? Do cursive links break if parts of a word are marked up or styled? Do Unicode joiner and non-joiner characters behave as expected?   <a href="https://w3c.github.io/typography/index#cursive">See available information</a> or <a href="https://github.com/w3c/i18n-activity/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3Acursive%20label%3Atype-info-request">check for currently needed data</a>.</p>


    <p></p>
</section>



<section id="transforms" class="ok">
    <h3>Transforming characters</h3>
    <p class="status_prompt">Does your script need special text transforms that are not supported? Does your script convert letters to uppercase, capitalised and lowercase alternatives according to your typographic needs? Do you need to to convert between half-width and full-width presentation forms? <a href="https://w3c.github.io/typography/index#transforming_characters">See available information</a> or <a href="https://github.com/w3c/i18n-activity/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3Atext-transform%20label%3Atype-info-request">check for currently needed data</a>.</p>

    <p>See the issue in <a href="#fonts"></a> above. Apart from that, there are no issues with text-transforms.</p>
<p>Note that the concept of capitalisation (title-casing or sentence-casing) doesn't actually apply to modern Georgian text. When mkedruli is mapped to mtavruli uppercase, it is applied to one or more whole words at a time (like ALL CAPS). Therefore the CSS for this feature will be ignored by content authors.</p>
</section>



<section id="boundaries" class="tbd">
    <h3>Text segmentation &amp; selection</h3>
    <p class="status_prompt">This is about how text is divided into graphemes, words, sentences, etc., and behaviour associated with that. Do Unicode grapheme clusters appropriately segment character units for your script? When you double- or triple-click on the text, is the expected range of characters highlighted? When you move through the text with the cursor, or backspace, etc. do you see the expected behaviour?  (Some of the answers to these questions may be picker up in other sections, such as line-breaking, or initial-letter styling.) <a href="https://w3c.github.io/typography/index#graphemes">See available information</a> or <a href="https://github.com/w3c/i18n-activity/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3Aboundaries%20label%3Atype-info-request">check for currently needed data</a>.</p>


    <p></p>
</section>




<section id="textdecor" class="tbd">
    <h3>Text decoration</h3>
    <p class="status_prompt">This is about  ways of marking text (see also specific sections dedicated to quotations and inline notes/annotations). Is it possible to express emphasis or highlight content as expected? Bold, italic and under-/over-lines are not always appropriate, and some scripts have their own unique ways of doing things, that are not in the Western tradition at all. Text delimiters mark certain items or sections off from the main text, such as book names in Chinese, quotations, head markers in Tibetan, etc, and often involve the use of punctuation. Is there any behaviour that isn't well supported, such as overlines for numeric digits in Syriac?    Are there issues about the positioning or use of underlines? Some aspects related to the drawing of lines alongside or through text involve local typographic considerations. Do underlines need to be broken in special ways for this script? Do you need support for additional line shapes or widths? Does the distance or position of the lines relative to the text need to vary in ways that are not achievable? Are lines correctly drawn relative to vertical text?  <a href="https://w3c.github.io/typography/index#text_decoration">See available information</a> or <a href="https://github.com/w3c/i18n-activity/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3Atext-decoration%20label%3Atype-info-request">check for currently needed data</a>.</p>

</section>



<section id="quotations" class="advanced">
    <h3 class="reviewme">Quotations</h3>
    <p class="status_prompt">Are there any issues when dealing with quotations marks, especially when nested? Should block quotes be indented or handled specially? <a href="https://w3c.github.io/typography/index#quotations">See available information</a> or <a href="https://github.com/w3c/i18n-activity/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3Aquotations%20label%3Atype-info-request">check for currently needed data</a>.</p>


<section id="q_defaults">
<h4><a href="#q_defaults">Default quotation marks for q element</a></h4>
<p>If the <code class="kw" translate="no">html</code> tag sets the language of a page, the HTML specification says that  the <code class="kw" translate="no">q</code> element should by default produce quotation marks according to the information in CLDR for that language.</p>
<p>For Georgian, CLDR says that the default quote marks should be, reading right to left, “...”, and embedded quote marks ‘...’. <strong>Edge</strong> fails to produce any quotation marks, although it does so for other languages. (Firefox, Chrome &amp; Safari are ok.) See a <a href="https://w3c.github.io/i18n-tests/results/the-q-element.html#language">test and results</a>.</p>
</section>

<section id="q_section">
<h4><a href="#q_section">Default quotation marks in a new language section</a></h4>
<p>In addition, the default quotation marks for the <code class="kw" translate="no">q</code> element  are not set to the appropriate characters by the browser  when the element appears inside a Georgian section of a page that has a different overall language. This is currently per the HTML specification (both W3C and WhatWG).  There is <a href="https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/3636#issuecomment-384340053">an issue</a> raised against the WhatWG version for this to be changed.</p>
</section>

<section id="q_multilingual">
<h4><a href="#q_multilingual">Embedded quotations in a different language</a></h4>
<p>Georgian quotes embedded in text in another language can also be problematic if the outer language uses different quotation marks. This is due to the browsers choosing default quotation marks based on the language of the <em>quotation</em>, rather than that of the surrounding text. See <a href="https://w3c.github.io/i18n-tests/results/the-q-element.html#ml_nesting">a test</a>. This behaviour is specified in the WhatWG version of the HTML spec, but no longer in the W3C version. There is <a href="https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/3636#issuecomment-384340053">an issue</a> raised against the WhatWG version for this to be changed.</p>
</section>

<p>Marking all the above as advanced, because use of the <code class="kw" translate="no">q</code> element is optional (quote characters can be used instead), and it can be styled using CSS for the general case.</p>

<section id="inlinenotes" class="tbd">
    <h3>Inline notes &amp; annotations</h3>
    <p class="status_prompt">The ruby spec currently specifies an initial subset of requirements for fine-tuning the typography of phonetic and semantic annotations of East Asian text, including furigana, pinyin and zhuyin fuhao systems.

    <p class="status_prompt">The CSS Counter Styles specification describes a limited set of simple and complex styles for counters to be used in list numbering, chapter heading numbering, etc.The rules plus more counter styles (totalling around 120 for over 30 scripts) are listed in the document <a href="https://w3c.github.io/predefined-counter-styles/">Ready-made Counter Styles</a>. Do these cover your needs?  Are the details correct? Are there other aspects related to counters and lists that need to be addressed? <a href="https://w3c.github.io/typography/index#counters">See available information</a> or <a href="https://github.com/w3c/i18n-activity/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3Acounter-styles%20label%3Atype-info-request">check for currently needed data</a>.</p>


	<p>A traditional <code>georgian</code> CSS counter style is defined in the document <a href="https://w3c.github.io/predefined-counter-styles/#georgian-styles">Ready-made Counter Styles</a>.  The same style is also defined in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-counter-styles-3/#georgian">CSS Counter Styles specification</a>.</p>
<p><span class="pass">All major browsers</span> support this style (see the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/i18n-tests/results/custom-counter-styles#georgian">tests and results</a> in the i18n test suite).</p>
<p>Note that the counters include characters that are currently regarded as archaic in running text.</p>

    <h3>Styling initials</h3>
    <p class="status_prompt">Does the browser or ereader correctly handle special styling of the initial letter of a line or paragraph, such as for drop caps or similar? How about  the size relationship between the large letter and the lines alongide? where does the large letter anchor relative to the lines alongside? is it normal to include initial quote marks in the large letter? is the large letter really a syllable? etc. Are all of these things working as expected? .<a href="https://w3c.github.io/typography/index#initial_letter">See available information</a> or <a href="https://github.com/w3c/i18n-activity/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3Ainitial-letter%20label%3Atype-info-request">check for currently needed data</a>.</p>

    <h3>General page layout &amp; progression</h3>
    <p class="status_prompt">How are the main text area and ancilliary areas positioned and defined? Are there any special requirements here, such as dimensions in characters for the Japanese kihon hanmen? The book cover for scripts that are read right-to-left scripts is on the right of the spine, rather than the left. Is that provided for? When content can flow vertically and to the left or right, how do you specify the location of objects, text, etc. relative to the flow? For example, keywords 'left' and 'right' are likely to need to be reversed for pages written in English and page written in Arabic. Do tables and grid layouts work as expected? How do columns work in vertical text? Can you mix block of vertical and horizontal text correctly? Does text scroll in the expected direction? <a href="https://w3c.github.io/typography/index#direction_agnostic">See available information</a> or <a href="https://github.com/w3c/i18n-activity/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3Abidi%20label%3Atype-info-request">check for currently needed data</a>.</p>

    <h3>Other page layout &amp; pagination features</h3>
    <p class="status_prompt">Some cultures define page areas and page progression direction very differently from those in the West (eg. kihon hanmen in Japanese). Is this an issue for you?

    <h3>What else?</h3>
    <p class="status_prompt">There are many other CSS modules which may need review for script-specific requirements, not to mention the SVG, HTML, Speech, MathML and other specifications.
