  <section id="h_introduction">
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>The W3C needs to make sure that the text layout and typographic needs of scripts and languages around the world are built in to technologies such as HTML, CSS, SVG, etc. so that Web pages and eBooks can look and behave as people expect around the world.</p>
    
    <p>This page documents issues for a given script or language in terms of support by specifications or user agents (browsers, e-readers, etc.). </p>

    <p>A summary of this report and others can be found as part of the <a href="http://w3c.github.io/typography/gap-analysis/language-matrix.html" style="font-size: 140%;">language matrix</a>.</p>
    
    <section id="workflow">
    <h3>Work flow</h3>
    <p><span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 140%;">This version of the document is a preliminary analysis</span></p>

    <p>Gap analysis work usually starts with a <strong>preliminary analysis</strong>, conducted quickly by one or a small group of experts. Then a more <strong>detailed analysis</strong> is carried out, involving a wider range of experts. The detailed analysis may involve the development of tests, in order to illustrate issues and track results for browsers. The next phase is <strong>ongoing maintenance</strong>. It is expected that the resulting document will not be frozen: as gaps are fixed, this should be noted in the document. It is also possible that new gaps are noticed or arise, and they can be added to this document when that happens.</p>
    
    <!--p>As the gap analysis develops, the requirements for features that are problematic should be described in the companion document, <a href="https://w3c.github.io/xxxlreq/">Text Layout Requirements for the Xxxx Script</a>. Links to the appropriate part of that document should be added to this document as the material is created. Note that the requirements document should not contain any technology-specific information: all of that belongs here.</p-->
    </section>
    
    <section id="prioritization">
    <h3>Prioritization</h3>
    <p>This document not only describes gaps, it also attempts to prioritise them in terms of the impact on the local user. The prioritisation is indicated by colour.</p>
        
        <p>Key:</p>
  <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
        <li class="ok"></li>
        <li class="na"></li>
        <li class="advanced"></li>
        <li class="basic"></li>
        <li class="broken"></li>
        <li class="tbd"></li>
        </ul>
    
    <p>It is important to note that these colours do not indicate to what extent a particular features is broken. They indicate the impact of a broken or missing feature on the content author or end user.</p>
    <p>Basic styling is the level that would be generally accepted as sufficient for most Web pages. Advanced level support would include additional features one might expect to include in ebooks or other advanced typographic formats. There may be features of a script or language that are not supported on the Web, but that are not generally regarded as necessary (usually archaic or obscure features). In this case, the feature can be described here, but the status should be marked as OK.</p>
    <p>The decision as to what priority level is assigned to a described gap is down to the experts doing the gap analysis. It may not always be straightforward to decide. If a given section in this document refers to more than one feature that is broken, each with different impacts on Web users, the priority for the section should be the lowest denominator.</p>
    <p>A cell can be scored as OK if the feature in question is specified in an appropriate specification, and is supported by user agents. A specification that is in CR or later and has two implementations in 'major' browsers will count. This means that the feature may not be supported in all browsers yet. (At some point in the future we may try to distinguish, visually, whether support is available in a specification but still pending in major browsers or applications.) </p>

<section id="direction">
    <h2>Text direction</h2>
<p>See also General page layout &amp; progression for features such as column layout, page turning direction, etc. that are affected by text direction.</p>

<section id="vertical" class="advanced">
<h3>Vertical text</h3>
    <p class="status_prompt">Are the script requirements for vertically oriented text met?  What about if you mix vertical text with scripts that are normally only horizontal? Do you need a switch to use different characters in vertical vs. horizontal text? Does the browser support short runs of horizontal text in vertical lines (tate-chu-yoko in Japanese) as expected? Is the orientation of characters and the directional ordering of characters supported as needed? <a href="https://w3c.github.io/typography/index#vertical_text">See available information</a> or <a href="https://github.com/w3c/i18n-activity/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3Avertical-text%20label%3Atype-info-request">check for currently needed data</a>.</p>



    <p>Vertical text may occur for special effects (the spine of a book, table column headings). Typographically, it is simply horizontal text that is rotated. The ‘writing-modes: sideways-lr/rl’ CSS feature should solve that, but isn't supported yet.</p>
</section>




<section id="bidi" class="na">
    <h3>Bidirectional text</h3>
    <p class="status_prompt">If this script runs right-to-left, are there any issues when handling that? Is bidirectional text adequately supported? What about numbers and expressions? Do the Unicode bidi controls and HTML markup provide the support needed? Is isolation of directional runs problematic? <a href="https://w3c.github.io/typography/index#bidirectional_text_direction">See available information</a> or <a href="https://github.com/w3c/i18n-activity/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3Abidi%20label%3Atype-info-request">check for currently needed data</a>.</p>

<section id="h_characters_and_phrases">
<h2>Characters and phrases</h2>
    
    
    
<section id="encoding" class="ok">
    <h3>Characters &amp; encoding</h3>
    <p class="status_prompt">Are there any character repertoire issues preventing use of this script on the Web? Do variation selectors need attention? Are there any other encoding-related issues?</p>

    <p>The presence of a Hungarian specific diacritic (&quot;) means that ISO-8859-1 cannot be used; instead, ISO-8859-2 must be used (or UTF-8). In the early days of the Web this was not really well handled on Hungarian Web sites, and they usually used, for example, 'õ' instead of 'ő', even for texts like online newspapers. The problem seems to have disappeared by now with UTF-8 coming to the fore, although I still found a <a href="http://www.magyarora.com/magyar/grammar.html">page</a> doing that (oh irony! it is a page on Hungarian Grammar:-)</p>
    </section>



<section id="fonts" class="ok">
    <h3>Fonts</h3>
    <p class="status_prompt">Do the standard fallback fonts used in browsers (eg. serif, sans-serif, cursive, etc.) match expectations? Are special font or OpenType features needed for this script that are not available?  <a href="https://w3c.github.io/typography/index#font-style">See available information</a> or <a href="https://github.com/w3c/i18n-activity/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3Afont-style%20label%3Atype-info-request">check for currently needed data</a>.</p>

    <p></p>
</section>



<section id="fontstyle" class="ok">
    <h3>Font  styles, weight, etc</h3>
    <p id="fontstylePrompt" class="status_prompt"> This covers ways of modifying the glyphs, such as for italicisation, bolding, oblique, etc. Do italic fonts lean in the right direction? Is synthesised italicisation problematic? Are there other problems relating to bolding or italicisation - perhaps relating to generalised assumptions of applicability? <a href="https://w3c.github.io/typography/index#font-style">See available information</a> or <a href="https://github.com/w3c/i18n-activity/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3Afont-style%20label%3Atype-info-request">check for currently needed data</a>.</p>


    <p></p>
    </section>



<section id="glyphs" class="ok">
    <h3>Glyph shaping and positioning</h3>
    <p class="status_prompt">Does the script in question require additional user control features to support alterations to the position or shape of glyphs, for example adjusting the distance between the base text and diacritics, or changing the glyphs used in a systematic way? Do you need to be able to compose/decompose conjuncts, or show characters that are otherwise hidden, etc? <a href="../index#glyphs_diacritics">See available information</a> or <a href="https://github.com/w3c/i18n-activity/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3Aglyphs-diacritics%20label%3Atype-info-request">check for currently needed data</a>.</p>



    <p></p>
    </section>



<section id="cursive" class="na">
    <h3>Cursive text</h3>
    <p class="status_prompt"> If this script is cursive (eg. Arabic, N'Ko, Syriac, etc), are there problems or needed features related to the handling of cursive text? Do cursive links break if parts of a word are marked up or styled? Do Unicode joiner and non-joiner characters behave as expected?   <a href="https://w3c.github.io/typography/index#cursive">See available information</a> or <a href="https://github.com/w3c/i18n-activity/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3Acursive%20label%3Atype-info-request">check for currently needed data</a>.</p>


    <p></p>
    </section>



<section id="transforms" class="ok">
    <h3>Transforming characters</h3>
    <p class="status_prompt">Does your script need special text transforms that are not supported? Does your script convert letters to uppercase, capitalised and lowercase alternatives according to your typographic needs? Do you need to to convert between half-width and full-width presentation forms? <a href="https://w3c.github.io/typography/index#transforming_characters">See available information</a> or <a href="https://github.com/w3c/i18n-activity/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3Atext-transform%20label%3Atype-info-request">check for currently needed data</a>.</p>

    <p>Hungarian has a number of digraphs, like 'gy', 'ty', 'sz', that refer to distinct, different sounds. However, the typography rules do not follow this: capitalization is &quot;Gyomor&quot;, instead of &quot;GYomor&quot;. Ie, they are not considered, typographically, as single letters (in contrast to the Dutch &quot;ij&quot;). Consequently the usual transformations work.</p>
<p>See also the section on <a href="#initial_letter">initial letter styling</a>.</p>
</section>




<section id="boundaries" class="ok">
    <h3>Text segmentation &amp; selection</h3>
    <p class="status_prompt">This is about how text is divided into graphemes, words, sentences, etc., and behaviour associated with that. Do Unicode grapheme clusters appropriately segment character units for your script? When you double- or triple-click on the text, is the expected range of characters highlighted? When you move through the text with the cursor, or backspace, etc. do you see the expected behaviour?  (Some of the answers to these questions may be picker up in other sections, such as line-breaking, or initial-letter styling.)   <a href="https://w3c.github.io/typography/index#graphemes">See available information</a>  or <a href="https://github.com/w3c/i18n-activity/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3Aboundaries%20label%3Atype-info-request">check for currently needed data</a>.</p>


    <p> You might expect double click to select a word including any apostrophes ('s, 't, dia's). Some software does, some doesn't. Ditto for words with dashes (ex-voetballer, vice-voorzitter), but no software on or off the Web seems to do so.</p>
    </section>
    
    
    
<section id="textdecor" class="ok">
    <h3>Text decoration</h3>
    <p class="status_prompt">This is about  ways of marking text (see also specific sections dedicated to quotations and inline notes/annotations). Is it possible to express emphasis or highlight content as expected? Bold, italic and under-/over-lines are not always appropriate, and some scripts have their own unique ways of doing things, that are not in the Western tradition at all. Text delimiters mark certain items or sections off from the main text, such as book names in Chinese, quotations, head markers in Tibetan, etc, and often involve the use of punctuation. Is there any behaviour that isn't well supported, such as overlines for numeric digits in Syriac?    Are there issues about the positioning or use of underlines? Some aspects related to the drawing of lines alongside or through text involve local typographic considerations. Do underlines need to be broken in special ways for this script? Do you need support for additional line shapes or widths? Does the distance or position of the lines relative to the text need to vary in ways that are not achievable? Are lines correctly drawn relative to vertical text?  <a href="https://w3c.github.io/typography/index#text_decoration">See available information</a> or <a href="https://github.com/w3c/i18n-activity/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3Atext-decoration%20label%3Atype-info-request">check for currently needed data</a>.</p>


    <p>&nbsp;</p>
</section>



<section id="quotations" class="basic">
    <h3>Quotations</h3>
    <p class="status_prompt">Are there any issues when dealing with quotations marks, especially when nested? Should block quotes be indented or handled specially? <a href="https://w3c.github.io/typography/index#quotations">See available information</a> or <a href="https://github.com/w3c/i18n-activity/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3Aquotations%20label%3Atype-info-request">check for currently needed data</a>.</p>


    <p>Hungarian uses the German-style quotations marks, e.g., „Jónapot”. When using the &lt;q&gt; element some browsers do it right (e.g., Chrome, Safari) but, e.g., Mozilla does not.</p>
</section>



<section id="inlinenotes" class="ok">
    <h3>Inline notes &amp; annotations</h3>
    <p class="status_prompt">The ruby spec currently specifies an initial subset of requirements for fine-tuning the typography of phonetic and semantic annotations of East Asian text, including furigana, pinyin and zhuyin fuhao systems.  Is is adequate for what it sets out to do?  What other controls will be needed in the future? What about other types of inline annotation, such as warichu? (For referent-type notes such as footnotes, see below.) <a href="https://w3c.github.io/typography/index#ruby_annotation">See available information</a> or <a href="https://github.com/w3c/i18n-activity/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3Aruby%20label%3Atype-info-request">check for currently needed data</a>.</p>

    <h3>Numbers, dates, etc.</h3>
    <p class="status_prompt">If  the script has its own set of number digits, are there any issues in how they are used? Does the script or language use special format patterns that are problematic (eg. 12,34,000 in India)? What about date/time formats and selection - and are non-Gregorian calendars needed?  Do percent signs and other symbols associated with number work correctly, and do numbers need special decorations, (like in Ethiopic or Syriac)? <a href="https://w3c.github.io/typography/index#numbers">See available information</a> or <a href="https://github.com/w3c/i18n-activity/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3Anumbers%20label%3Atype-info-request">check for currently needed data</a>.</p>

<h2>Lines and Paragraphs</h2>

 
<section id="linebreak" class="ok">
    <h3>Line breaking</h3>
    <p class="status_prompt">Does the browser capture the rules about the way text in your script wraps when it hits the end of a line? Does line-breaking wrap whole 'words' at a time, or characters, or something else (such as syllables in Tibetan and Javanese)?  What characters should not appear at the end or start of a line, and what should be done to prevent that? <a href="https://w3c.github.io/typography/index#line_breaking">See available information</a> or <a href="https://github.com/w3c/i18n-activity/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3Aline-break%20label%3Atype-info-request">check for currently needed data</a>.</p>


    <p></p>
</section>



<section id="hyphenation" class="advanced">
    <h3>Hyphenation</h3>
    <p class="status_prompt">Is hyphenation used for your script, or something else? If hyphenation is used, does it work as expected? (Note, this is about line-end hyphenation when text is wrapped, rather than use of the hyphen and related characters as punctuation marks.) <a href="https://w3c.github.io/typography/index#hyphenation">See available information</a> or <a href="https://github.com/w3c/i18n-activity/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3Ahyphenation%20label%3Atype-info-request">check for currently needed data</a>.</p>


    <p>Few browsers so far support hyphenation. It works on FF (yay!) but it does not work on Chrome or Safari.</p>
<p>Hyphenation has some more complex rules (handling compound words, digraphs, rules on repeated letters expressing emphasis-like longer sounds, etc.). It would need a more systematic test to decide whether everything is fine on FF but, at first glance, it seems to be working fine. It does not use the break opportunities when digraphs are duplicated. E.g., in &quot;Összeg&quot; the &quot;ssz&quot; is a shortened form for &quot;szsz&quot;, i.e., a double &quot;sz&quot; digraph; when hyphenating, one could do a &quot;Ösz-szeg&quot; which FF doesn't do. That being said, it is a bit of an edge case and people often do what FF does. I.e., I guess an &quot;ok&quot; status is fine for FF. But the non-existent hyphenation in other browsers means that the feature is still &quot;advanced&quot;.</p>
</section>



<section id="justification" class="ok">
    <h3>Text alignment &amp; justification</h3>
    <p class="status_prompt"> When text in a paragraph needs to have flush lines down both sides, does it follow the rules for your script? Does the script need assistance to conform to a grid pattern? Does your script allow punctuation to hang outside the text box at the start or end of a line? Where adjustments are need to make a line flush, how is that done? Do you shrink/stretch space between words and/or letters? Are word baselines stretched, as in Arabic? What about paragraph indents, or the need for logical alignment keywords, such as start/end, rather than left/right? <a href="https://w3c.github.io/typography/index#justification">See available information</a> or <a href="https://github.com/w3c/i18n-activity/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3Ajustification%20label%3Atype-info-request">check for currently needed data</a>.</p>

How about  the size relationship between the large letter and the lines alongide? where does the large letter anchor relative to the lines alongside? is it normal to include initial quote marks in the large letter? is the large letter really a syllable? etc. Are all of these things working as expected? .<a href="https://w3c.github.io/typography/index#initial_letter">See available information</a> or <a href="https://github.com/w3c/i18n-activity/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3Ainitial-letter%20label%3Atype-info-request">check for currently needed data</a>.</p>

    <h3>General page layout &amp; progression</h3>
    <p class="status_prompt">How are the main text area and ancilliary areas positioned and defined? Are there any special requirements here, such as dimensions in characters for the Japanese kihon hanmen? The book cover for scripts that are read right-to-left scripts is on the right of the spine, rather than the left. Is that provided for? When content can flow vertically and to the left or right, how do you specify the location of objects, text, etc. relative to the flow? For example, keywords 'left' and 'right' are likely to need to be reversed for pages written in English and page written in Arabic. Do tables and grid layouts work as expected? How do columns work in vertical text? Can you mix block of vertical and horizontal text correctly? Does text scroll in the expected direction? <a href="https://w3c.github.io/typography/index#direction_agnostic">See available information</a> or <a href="https://github.com/w3c/i18n-activity/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3Abidi%20label%3Atype-info-request">check for currently needed data</a>.</p>

    <h3>What else?</h3>
    <p class="status_prompt">There are many other CSS modules which may need review for script-specific requirements, not to mention the SVG, HTML, Speech, MathML and other specifications. What else is likely to cause problems for worldwide deployment of the Web, and what requirements need to be addressed to make the Web function well locally?</p>


    <p>Some other characteristics of Hungarian (none of which pose problems on the Web): </p>
<ul>
<li>The rules for quotation marks and their nesting are similar to British English. However, punctuation is different: whereas in English one would put the full stop before the bracket like in "(A bracketed text.)", Hungarian does it the other way round like "(Zárójeles szöveg)." </li>
<li>Text is typically way longer than equivalent English text and words are often much longer on average, too. </li>
<li>Pronunciation is mostly easy to guess from the spelling. The other way round may be more complicated, because there are cases when the same sound can be written in different ways (e.g., "ly" and "j"), or because today's pronounciation tends to be less careful. This may be relevant for text-to-speech. </li>
<li>Numbers use a space between thousands and a comma before the decimals. The ‘0’ before the comma cannot be omitted (‘0,5’ but not ‘,5’). </li>
<li>Negative numbers start with a minus or dash.</li>
<li>The currency symbol is used after the amount (10Ft). </li>
<li>There is no space before punctuation ("<span lang="hu">akkor,</span>", "<span lang="hu">mondta:</span>", "<span lang="ok">rendben van!</span>"). </li>
<li>There is a simple space after the full stop at the end of a sentence. </li>
<li>When text on the spine of a book is rotated, it is always in such a way that the book can lie with the back cover on top (i.e., like in French but different from English). </li>
<li>The language uses a fair number of diacritics; one of those, used on the letters 'o' and 'u', is, afaik, specific to Hungarian: 'ő' and 'ű' (and their capitalized counterpart). Diacritics are important for the meaning of the words, and cannot be ommitted or replaced even when capitalized (in contrast to French which usually drops diacritics for capital letters): e.g., "Álom" means "Dream", whereas "Alom" means "Litter". </li>
<li>An i18n issue for Hungarian is the fact that Hungarian names are in reverse order compared to all other European languages: it is family name followed by surname. I.e., it is "Herman Iván", and not "Iván Herman". (This is the same as for a number of Asian languages, afaik.) This means that Web forms using the term "first name" and "last name" are the source of endless confusions for Hungarians. </li>
<li>Although I presume this is more a matter for Unicode, for the sorting order digraphs are considered to be different letters; in the order of letters, the digraph immediately follows the first letter. I.e., "c"  is followed by "cs" and is before the "d" in the ABC, and the word “cukor” (sugar) precedes the word “csupor” (mug) in a dictionary, because "cs" is a digraph. </li>
</ul>
